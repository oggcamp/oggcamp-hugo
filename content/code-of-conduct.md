All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our OggCamp are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

## Health & Safety

The pandemic has hit the events industry hard as all events have one thing in common: To bring people together. We want to do this in a way that is as safe and inclusive as possible. We want you to have a safe and comfortable experience at OggCamp.

Since we cannot predict how the situation will be at the event date, the rules & guidelines below may change. We guarantee however, that the rules will only be strengthened, and never weakened.

Below are the current rules & guidelines for OggCamp 2024:

- We strongly recommend that everyone who attends OggCamp 2024 onsite be vaccinated with two vaccinations plus any additional booster shots that are medically recommended.
- We request that anyone sick or experiencing any cold/flu-like symptoms stay home for their own safety and the safety of others. Likewise, if you experience any of these symptoms during the event, please consider the safety of others and ensure you follow current isolation guidelines.
- We encourage you to to test yourself for COVID-19 before attending the event.

Furthermore:

- Free FFP2 masks will be available at the event for those who would like them.
- COVID Lateral Flow Tests will be made available during the event, particularly to those experiencing symptoms.
- All rooms will be ventilated as best we can during the event.

We will update these rules as required and also provide you with additional information as they become available. If you have any questions, concerns or recommendations, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to us at contact@oggcamp.org.


## The Quick Version

Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded clothing. If you can't find a member of the conference staff, please phone **number tbc** where the phone with that number on will be held by a duty crew member.

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.

## What to expect if you report a Code of Conduct issue

If you report an incident in-person to a crew member, we expect that they will ensure there is a second crew member to hear your issue. One of these two people will remain with you, while the other locates an organiser. Once an organiser has been found, you'll be handed over to them while an investigation occurs. Where appropriate, emergency services will also be contacted in parallel with this process.

If you report an incident by phone, this will be to an organiser. Where possible, either an organiser or a crew member will make their way to your location to assist you while the investigation occurs. Again, where appropriate, emergency services will be contacted in parallel with this process.
