We're back on April 25th - 26th, 2026 at [The Manchester Conference Centre](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/135912649)

While you don't *have* to have a ticket to come to OggCamp, registering helps us to know how many people to expect and provide you with a better experience.

* £40 is our **suggested** amount. Across the industry, sponsors are hard to come by so by asking you to contribute, you help us to ensure OggCamp is a success.
* You can absolutely put £1 in the amount box if that's what you can afford. (We just ask that you cover the fees for our ticketing platform)
* Alternatively, if you would like to make a larger payment to help cover costs we certainly won't argue! We've also introduced a "Professional" ticket tier this year, intended for those needing a fixed-price ticket to charge back to their company.

**OggCamp Tickets are now available!** Please visit ["tickets dot"](https://tickets.oggcamp.org) to get signed up! Our early bird tickets give £5 off of the suggested price and are available until January 1st
